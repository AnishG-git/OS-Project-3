- I reviewed the project requirements for the B-Tree Index File Manager. The project involves building a command-line Python tool to manage B-Tree index files with strict memory constraints and a specific binary file format. My initial focus will be on setting up the project structure and implementing the 'create' command, which initializes a new index file with the correct header format.
